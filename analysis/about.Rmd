Computational ATAC-seq analysis of human amniotic epithelial cells (HAECs) between normoxia and hypoxia conditions

HAECs were from a single donor and then split into six small plates. Three plates were placed in hypoxia chamber where they were incubated at 1% oxygen, while the other three plates were placed in normal incubator at atmospheric oxygen concentrations.
